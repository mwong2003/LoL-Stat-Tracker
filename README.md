# LoL Stat Tracker

This project's main function is to get stats from various players, teams, and regions in the game, League of Legends 
(LoL). Using these stats, the user can compare them to see how they would match against each other. For example, I could  
input the KDA (kill/deaths/assists) stats of myself and a professional player by displaying it in a table to clearly see 
what I could work on to improve my own gameplay. Or maybe I could compare the average game time of different regions like 
North America and Europe and China to compare how the pace differs from slow-paced to fast-paced. These features will 
be mainly used by players and teams to compare what they need to work on in order to prepare for their opponents.
