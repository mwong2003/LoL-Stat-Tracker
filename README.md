# LoL Stat Tracker

## Proposal

This project's main function is to get stats from various players, teams, and regions in the game, League of Legends 
(LoL). Using these stats, the user can compare them to see how they would match against each other. For example, I could  
input the KDA (kill/deaths/assists) stats of myself and a professional player by displaying it in a graph to clearly see 
what I could work on to improve my own gameplay. Or maybe I could compare the average game time of different regions like 
North America and Europe and China to compare how the pace differs from slow-paced to fast-paced. These features will 
be mainly used by players and teams to compare what they need to work on in order to prepare for their opponents. 

I decided to choose this project because I think it would be useful to build a stat tracker since I personally have
a great interest in the game and it would be really useful for me to see these stats whether it would be for my own
improvement or to compare two teams and make a guess on who is better. 


List of features (more could be added):
- Creation of a team and adding/removing players within that team
- Add/remove/edit stats of teams/players
- Charts/graphs to visually see how players/teams differ
